    Guido van Rossum, the creator of our beloved programming language, states that “Python is an experiment in how much 
    freedom programmers need”. But have you ever wondered what the implications of such freedom are?
    In this talk, we will have a look at the Python “built-in guidelines” on how to write pythonic code, also known as
    The Zen of Python, written by Tim Peters. I will use concepts present on the book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An eternal 
    Golden Braid (written by Douglas Hofstadter) to explain meaning and relate it to Freedom (both in life and coding)
    and the human nature of biased perspective.

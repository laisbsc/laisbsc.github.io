    Guido van Rossum, the creator of our beloved programming language, states that “Python is an experiment in how much 
    freedom programmers need”. But have you ever wondered what the implications of such freedom are?
    <br> In this talk, we will have a look at the Python “built-in guidelines” on how to write pythonic code, also known as
    The Zen of Python, written by Tim Peters. I will use concepts present on the book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An eternal 
    Golden Braid (written by Douglas Hofstadter) to explain meaning and relate it to Freedom (both in life and coding)
    and the human nature of biased perspective. </br>

    My journey with HumbleData started in 2021, when I was mentored as part of the PyCon Namibia event.
    <br> Humble Data aims at lowering the entry-barrier for underrepresented
    minorities into technology, specifically Python and Data Science.</br>
    <br> I have organised workshops at: EuroPython Dublin 2022 and 2023, PyCon Spain 2023, PyCon Italy 2024, PyCon DE 2024. </br>
